Boy i hope this works now.

Did not touch the sidebar position field


UPDATE IT DID. It updated to 7

Now i will change the sidebar position in the field above to 5 and close and merge via Decap CMS. THis should override again to 7

I changed the sidebar back to 5 via github review. But if i commit the change i suspect it will run the workflow file again.
